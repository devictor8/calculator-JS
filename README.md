# Mini Calculator 

<p>I'm doing this project to test my JS skills. I recently started learning this language and through this mini project I intend to show my evolution</p>

# How's it going...
<p>At the moment I made this calculator solve simple math problems like +, -, * and /. However, there are still validation bugs that I intend to resolve in the future.</p>
